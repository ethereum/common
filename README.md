# SYNOPSIS

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ethereumjs/common.svg?branch=master&style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/ethereumjs/common)

[DEPRECATION NOTE] This library is deprecated in favor of a newly conceptualized [ethereumjs-common](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-common) library with support for different chain and
hardfork settings.

If you use this library to read parameters for your own library, consider switching to the ``ethereumjs-common``
library on one of your next releases. If you need assistance on this, reach out on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/ethereumjs).
